# QA Interview Bible

QA Interview Bible is a long-term public knowledge base for software quality, testing, and engineering communication. It is designed to be professional, reusable, and safe to share with future employers.

## Repository purpose

This repository exists to document durable software engineering knowledge, especially in areas such as:

- quality engineering fundamentals
- test strategy and planning
- automation design
- API and mobile testing
- debugging and defect analysis
- interview preparation
- technical leadership and communication

The goal is not to preserve company-specific implementation details. The goal is to publish educational material that remains useful across teams, products, and industries.

## Public portfolio standards

This repository is public and should always remain suitable for external readers.

- Never include confidential, proprietary, regulated, or internal-only information.
- Generalize all examples, incidents, workflows, architectures, and datasets.
- Focus on transferable engineering reasoning instead of employer-specific process.
- Write every page so it can teach someone outside the original context.
